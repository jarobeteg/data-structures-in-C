- Stack (pop, push, remove, check if empty or full, etc.)
- Queue (insert, remove, check if empty or full, etc.)
- Deque (insert, remove, check if empty or full, etc.)
- Binary Tree (insert, remove, traverse, search, find height, find the number of nodes or leaves, etc.)
- Binary Search Tree (insert, remove, search, find min/max element, check if tree is balanced, etc.)
- Hash Table (insert key-value pair, remove key, search for key, etc.)
